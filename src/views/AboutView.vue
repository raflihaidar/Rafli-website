              someone

              <span class="text-green-600">creative and
                a logical side</span>. When I discovered web design in college, I realized it would be the perfect fit. I
              could use
              my creative side to design and my logical side to code. As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows
              me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.
